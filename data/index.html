        <p> <strong> Published by The Diamondback </strong> | October 9, 2023 </p>
        <p> For the map visualization, I cleaned a dataset of more than 70 names and addresses of cannabis dispensaries in Maryland
            with Excel. After that, I used Flourish to create an interactive projection map that shows the location of
            the dispensaries in Maryland. The column chart to compares the monetary adult-use and
            medical-use sales of cannabis over three years in Maryland. My reporting includes interviews with county council members and a cannabis dispensary owner about how zoning ordinaces will affect Prince George's County.</p>

        <p> To find the most popular dining hall at my university, I made a FOIA request for the number of hand waves in the dining halls between 2017 to 2022. I analyzed that
            data in Excel and then used Flourish to create an interactive line chart that displayed the trends in four
            dining halls over five years. I also created an interactive column chart with Flourish to show the popularity of dining halls during the Fall 2022 semester.

        <p> For this projection map, I used data from the Maryland State Department of Education to display the participation rates in prekindergarten by county. Marijke and I interviewed about a dozen early childhood education experts in how the Blueprint for Maryland's Future will affect prekindergarten. The article is part of a larger series in the Local News Network and was picked up by various news outlets, including The Baltimore Sun, The Capital Gazette, The Daily Record and MoCo360 Media.

        <p> My analysis into the diversity of STEM faculty at my university started when I extracted data from the university's institutional research, planning and assessment office. I refined the three-year dataset into a Google Sheet and then visualized the racial and gender makeup of STEM faculty in 2023 with Flourish.
