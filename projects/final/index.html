            <p>Millions of readers across the world flock to their screens each year to vote for their favorite books in
                the <b><a
                href="https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2023"  target="_blank">Goodreads Choice Awards</a></b>. The online voting on dozens of books is run by Goodreads — the world’s
                largest website for readers and book recommendations. </p>

            <p>Anyone with a Goodreads account can participate in the Choice Awards. The voting separates books into
                several categories — including fiction, fantasy and historical fiction — and allows readers to vote on
                their favorites in each category. </p>

                    <p>Some of the most popular books in 2023, as voted on by GoodReads readers, included fan favorites

                    <p>However, the book that won its category by the largest landslide in 2023 was “Fourth Wing” by
                        Rebecca
                        Yaros. This fantasy book, which debuted in May, features the journey of a 20-year-old girl as

                        joins
                        hundreds of candidates to become an elite rider in a dragon-riding school. The book is a blend
                        of
                        war,
                        dragons, magic, romance, enemies and overcoming adversity.
                    </p>

                    <p>“Fourth Wing” has sold more than 2 million copies globally and has appeared on the New York Times
                        bestseller list for more than six months. The saga continues in Yaros’ second novel, “Iron
                        Flame.”
                    </p>
                    <p>This book has dominated its romantasy category with 397,565 votes — meaning that the novel made
                        up
                        almost
                        70 percent of votes in its category. The runner-up for the romantasy category was “Assistant To
                        The

                        The next two books that saw the biggest percentage of votes in their categories were
                        “Yellowface” by R.F. Kuang and “The Woman in Me” by Britney Spears. Both of these books took
                        about 34 percent of votes in their respective categories of fiction and memoir.

                        Although readers were not required to vote on every single category, the amount of votes cast
                        for each category reflects the total popularity of different types of books.

                    <p>The dozens of books that the Goodreads Choice Awards saw in 2023 are among hundreds that have
                    been voted on by readers for more than a decade. The Choice Awards first started in 2011, when it
                    saw 2010s classics such as “Divergent” by Veronica Roth and “The Son of Neptune” by Rick Riordan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, voting on the GoodReads choice awards have increased by almost eight times from 2023 to
                        2011. This happened as GoodReads gained more popularity and trends such as BookTok increased
                        book engagement throughout the years. </p>
                    <p>The next GoodReads choice awards will most likely open around November 2024. Until then, readers
                        across the world will keep on digging into their favorite books.
