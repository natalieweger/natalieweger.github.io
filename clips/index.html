                ‘I’m building memories’: How a Baltimore resident founded Ovenbird Bakery
            </a> </h2>
            <p> July 30, 2024 </p>
            <p> This business profile tells the story of a former bird conservationist who made the leap to start up a bakery in Baltimore. His hobby of baking bread eventually led him to open up two businesses in the big city. Within a couple days of pitching this story, I was able to find a business owner to interview and feature for this piece.

            <p> July 16, 2024</p>
            <p> I spent four weeks calling about a dozen real estate experts across Maryland on a Realtor settlement anticipated to shake the industry. This long-form reporting project became an explainer piece that localized a nationwide concern of real estate commission rates.

            <p>   July 31, 2024  </p>
            <p> With sports tourism increasing across the nation, I pitched this story with an intent of covering the growing sports tourism industry in Maryland. This long-form story takes perspectives from tourism experts across the state to analyze how Maryland counties are investing in this expanding business.

            <p> October 9, 2023</p>
            <p> This article marked the beginning of The Diamondback’s recent news coverage of Israel and Palestine, a
                topic that held little precedent in our publication's reporting. My editors have a contribution line to
                this story because they
                guided me through navigating the sensitivity of reporting on a deep topic that has not been covered at
                the
                newspaper for years. I collaborated closely with them to ensure the language and context behind this
                story
                were appropriate and gave an accurate representation of students' emotions at the vigil.

            <p> February 22, 2023</p>
            <p> I visited Annapolis for the first time as a reporter for a lobby night that consisted of more than 50
                members from the University System of Maryland. I followed a group of housekeepers and facility workers
                from the University of Maryland as they urged their state senators to increase minimum wage and expand
                telework options. </p>

            <p> October 4, 2023</p>
            <p> A few minutes after The Diamondback heard about a bus crash, a photographer and I immediately drove to
                the
                scene, where I attended a press conference with a fire department and university spokesperson. I
                released
                the news shortly after the crash occurred and then updated the story that same day after speaking with
                passengers on the bus. </p>

            <p> November 13, 2023 </p>
            <p> For national First-Generation College Celebration Day, I trekked across campus with a photographer to
                conduct man on the street interviews with first-generation college students. This feature article and
                photo
                essay tells the stories of students at the University of Maryland and their journey to college. </p>

            <p> January 8, 2024</p>
            <p> This business profile tells the story of the man who founded a local icecream shop in my hometown.
                Carmen's
                Italian Ice serves as an epicenter of memories for many
                Rockville
                residents. I did on-scene reporting for this piece and sat down with the owner of the shop to hear
                about
                his family's journey in running the business. </p>
