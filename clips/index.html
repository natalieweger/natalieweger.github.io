                    America's Great Pickle Divide
                </a> </h2>
            <p> Aug. 10, 2025 </p>
            <p> After noticing an increase in pickle products across grocery shelves and fast food restaurants, I pitched this story to WSJ’s A-hed desk, which encourages reporters to write about the weirdest topics imaginable. I spent hours visiting pickle shops across New York City and interviewing self-proclaimed pickle haters to bring the trend to life. I aimed to turn a consumer trend piece into an engaging and fun read. The story ran on the front page in August.

            <p>Aug. 15, 2025</p>
            <p>After my colleagues on the newswires desk reported that Chipotle, Cava and Sweetgreen posted worsening sales in their latest quarter, I followed up with a story on the broader struggle of fast casual chains. Over three days, I interviewed several analysts and sifted through the companies’ earnings calls to provide deeper context to the story. The article ran on a half-page spread in the Journal’s business section.

            <p> 
                I filed a first take on ThredUp’s earnings shortly after the company’s post-market release, providing readers with a quick and accurate picture of the used-clothing online marketplace’s performance. Soon after, I interviewed ThredUp’s Chief Executive about the second-hand clothing market and the rise of weary consumer sentiment. I wrote through the article to weave in his insights, turning a standard earnings piece into a deeper story.

            <p> I wrote this local business profile for The Daily Record, a publicaton that often appeals to corporate
                leaders and business executives. I wanted to write a feature article to add more local nuance to the

                feature for this piece. It was published on the front page of the newspaper the next day.

            <p> I spoke with business owners across Maryland on how the state's lack of affordable childcare impacts
                their ability to retain workers. This article explains how lack of affordable childcare impacts business

            <p> I spent four weeks calling about a dozen real estate experts across Maryland on a Realtor settlement

            <p> This article marked the beginning of The Diamondback’s recent news coverage of Israel and Palestine, a
                topic that held little precedent in our publication's reporting. My editors have a contribution line to
                this story because they
                guided me through navigating the sensitivity of reporting on a deep topic that has not been covered at
                the
                newspaper for years. I collaborated closely with them to ensure the language and context behind this
                story
                were appropriate and gave an accurate representation of students' emotions at the vigil.

            <p> I visited Annapolis for the first time as a reporter for a lobby night that consisted of more than 50
                members from the University System of Maryland. I followed a group of housekeepers and facility workers
                from the University of Maryland as they urged their state senators to increase minimum wage and expand
                telework options. </p>

                Italian Ice serves as an epicenter of memories for many
                Rockville
                residents. I did on-scene reporting for this piece and sat down with the owner of the shop to hear
